### OpenPGP Smart Card Aaa Reader

## Introduction
The OSCAaaR project enables users and organizations alike to control access to physical spaces using open source multi-factor smart cards. Multi-Factor 
Authentication (MFA) enables strong authentication resistant to lost or stolen keys, and compromised passwords. The OpenPGP Smart Card, supported in 
GPG for some time, enables Authentication, Authorization, and will some audit logging Accounting capability in the form of reasonably secure signing 
and encryption. Users can be issued cards, with keys signed by an organization or self signed, allowing for strong, unforgable access controls.
The goal of this project is to create the code that can be deployed, and reference hardware for testing and debugging purposes, that can control a 
single door. Long term a network of controllers will allow for implementation of Certificate Revocation checks,facility wide access controls, and a far 
cheaper solution than traditional PIV smart cards.

## Prior Work
#### We stand on the shoulders of Giants.
This project is dependent on the work done by the GPG team, and the implementation of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). The Free Software Foundation has also 
provided excellent documentation for these smart cards, allowing for us to work towards a streamlined system anyone can use.
